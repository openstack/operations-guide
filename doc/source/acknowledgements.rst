The OpenStack Foundation supported the creation of this book with plane
tickets to Austin, lodging (including one adventurous evening without
power after a windstorm), and delicious food. For about USD $10,000, we
could collaborate intensively for a week in the same room at the
Rackspace Austin office. The authors are all members of the OpenStack
Foundation, which you can join. Go to the `Foundation web
site <https://www.openstack.org/join>`_.

We want to acknowledge our excellent host Rackers at Rackspace in
Austin:

-  Emma Richards of Rackspace Guest Relations took excellent care of our
   lunch orders and even set aside a pile of sticky notes that had
   fallen off the walls.

-  Betsy Hagemeier, a Fanatical Executive Assistant, took care of a room
   reshuffle and helped us settle in for the week.

-  The Real Estate team at Rackspace in Austin, also known as "The
   Victors," were super responsive.

-  Adam Powell in Racker IT supplied us with bandwidth each day and
   second monitors for those of us needing more screens.

-  On Wednesday night we had a fun happy hour with the Austin OpenStack
   Meetup group and Racker Katie Schmidt took great care of our group.

We also had some excellent input from outside of the room:

-  Tim Bell from CERN gave us feedback on the outline before we started
   and reviewed it mid-week.

-  SÃ©bastien Han has written excellent blogs and generously gave his
   permission for re-use.

-  Oisin Feeley read it, made some edits, and provided emailed feedback
   right when we asked.

Inside the book sprint room with us each day was our book sprint
facilitator Adam Hyde. Without his tireless support and encouragement,
we would have thought a book of this scope was impossible in five days.
Adam has proven the book sprint method effectively again and again. He
creates both tools and faith in collaborative authoring at
`www.booksprints.net <http://www.booksprints.net/>`_.

We couldn't have pulled it off without so much supportive help and
encouragement.
