Create an OpenStack Development Environment
===========================================

To create a development environment, you can use DevStack. DevStack is
essentially a collection of shell scripts and configuration files that
builds an OpenStack development environment for you. You use it to
create such an environment for developing a new feature.

For more information on installing DevStack, see the
`DevStack <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/>`_ website.
