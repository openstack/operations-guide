   Domain Name System (DNS)

      A system by which Internet domain name-to-address and

      interface. A VLAN network is a private network interface, which is
      controlled by the ``vlan_interface`` option with VLAN
      managers.

      storage for the Block Storage volume manager.

   volume worker

      A cinder component that interacts with back-end storage to manage
      the creation and deletion of volumes and the creation of compute
      volumes, provided by the cinder-volume daemon.

   vSphere

      An OpenStack-supported hypervisor.

   weighting

      A Compute process that determines the suitability of the VM
      instances for a job for a particular host. For example, not enough RAM
      on the host, too many CPUs on the host, and so on.

   weight

      Used by Object Storage devices to determine which storage
      devices are suitable for the job. Devices are weighted by size.

   weighted cost

      The sum of each cost used when deciding where to start a new VM
      instance in Compute.

   worker

      A daemon that listens to a queue and carries out tasks in
      response to messages. For example, the cinder-volume worker manages volume
      creation and deletion on storage arrays.
