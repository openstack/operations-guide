ask.openstack.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the set up or testing of OpenStack, you might have questions
about how a specific task is completed or be in a situation where a
feature does not work correctly. Use the
`ask.openstack.org <https://ask.openstack.org>`__ site to ask questions
and get answers. When you visit the https://ask.openstack.org site, scan
the recently asked questions to see whether your question has already
been answered. If not, ask a new question. Be sure to give a clear,
concise summary in the title and provide as much detail as possible in
the description. Paste in your command output or stack traces, links to
screen shots, and any other information which might be useful.

OpenStack mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A great way to get answers and insights is to post your question or
problematic scenario to the OpenStack mailing list. You can learn from
and help others who might have similar issues. To subscribe or view the
archives, go to
http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack. You might
be interested in the other mailing lists for specific projects or
development, which you can find `on the
wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/MailingLists>`__. A description of all
mailing lists is available at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/MailingLists.

The OpenStack wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `OpenStack wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/>`__ contains a broad
range of topics but some of the information can be difficult to find or
is a few pages deep. Fortunately, the wiki search feature enables you to
search by title or content. If you search for specific information, such
as about networking or OpenStack Compute, you can find a large amount
of relevant material. More is being added all the time, so be sure to
check back often. You can find the search box in the upper-right corner
of any OpenStack wiki page.

The Launchpad Bugs area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack community values your set up and testing efforts and wants
your feedback. To log a bug, you must sign up for a Launchpad account at
https://launchpad.net/+login. You can view existing bugs and report bugs
in the Launchpad Bugs area. Use the search feature to determine whether
the bug has already been reported or already been fixed. If it still
seems like your bug is unreported, fill out a bug report.

Some tips:

*  Give a clear, concise summary.

*  Provide as much detail as possible in the description. Paste in your
   command output or stack traces, links to screen shots, and any other
   information which might be useful.

*  Be sure to include the software and package versions that you are
   using, especially if you are using a development branch, such as,
   ``"Kilo release" vs git commit bc79c3ecc55929bac585d04a03475b72e06a3208``.

*  Any deployment-specific information is helpful, such as whether you
   are using Ubuntu 14.04 or are performing a multi-node installation.

The OpenStack IRC channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenStack community lives in the #openstack IRC channel on the
Freenode network. You can hang out, ask questions, or get immediate
feedback for urgent and pressing issues. To install an IRC client or use
a browser-based client, go to
`https://webchat.freenode.net/ <https://webchat.freenode.net>`__. You can
also use Colloquy (Mac OS X, http://colloquy.info/), mIRC (Windows,
http://www.mirc.com/), or XChat (Linux). When you are in the IRC channel
and want to share code or command output, the generally accepted method
is to use a Paste Bin. The OpenStack project has one at
http://paste.openstack.org. Just paste your longer amounts of text or
logs in the web form and you get a URL that you can paste into the
channel. The OpenStack IRC channel is ``#openstack`` on
``irc.freenode.net``. You can find a list of all OpenStack IRC channels
at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC.
