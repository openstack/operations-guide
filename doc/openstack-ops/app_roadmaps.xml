  <title>Working with Roadmaps</title>

  <para>The good news: OpenStack has unprecedented transparency when it comes
  to providing information about what's coming up. The bad news: each release
  moves very quickly. The purpose of this appendix is to highlight some of the
  useful pages to track, and take an educated guess at what is coming up in
  the next release and perhaps further afield.<indexterm class="singular">

  <para>OpenStack follows a six month release cycle, typically releasing in
  April/May and October/November each year. At the start of each cycle, the
  community gathers in a single location for a design summit. At the summit,
  the features for the coming releases are discussed, prioritized, and
  planned. <xref linkend="release-cycle-diagram" /> shows an example release
  cycle, with dates showing milestone releases, code freeze, and string freeze
  dates, along with an example of when the summit occurs. Milestones are
  interim releases within the cycle that are available as packages for
  download and testing. Code freeze is putting a stop to adding new features
  to the release. String freeze is putting a stop to changing any strings
  within the source code.</para>

    <title>Influencing the Roadmap</title>

    <para>OpenStack truly welcomes your ideas (and contributions) and highly
    values feedback from real-world users of the software. By learning a
    little about the process that drives feature development, you can
    participate and perhaps get the additions you desire.<indexterm
        class="singular">
        <primary>OpenStack community</primary>

        <secondary>working with roadmaps</secondary>

        <tertiary>influencing</tertiary>
      </indexterm></para>

    <para>Feature requests typically start their life in Etherpad, a
    collaborative editing tool, which is used to take coordinating notes at a
    design summit session specific to the feature. This then leads to the
    creation of a blueprint on the Launchpad site for the particular project,
    which is used to describe the feature more formally. Blueprints are then
    approved by project team members, and development can begin.</para>

    <para>Therefore, the fastest way to get your feature request up for
    consideration is to create an Etherpad with your ideas and propose a
    session to the design summit. If the design summit has already passed, you
    may also create a blueprint directly. Read this <link
    xlink:href="http://vmartinezdelacruz.com/how-to-work-with-blueprints-without-losing-your-mind/">blog post about how to work with
    blueprints</link> the perspective of Victoria Martínez, a developer
    intern.</para>

    <para>The roadmap for the next release as it is developed can be seen at
    <link xlink:href="http://status.openstack.org/release/">Releases</link>.</para>

    <para>To determine the potential features going in to future releases, or
    to look at features implemented previously, take a look at the existing
    blueprints such as&#160;<link
    xlink:href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova">OpenStack Compute (nova)
    Blueprints</link>, <link xlink:href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone">OpenStack
    Identity (keystone) Blueprints</link>, and release notes.</para>

    <para>Aside from the direct-to-blueprint pathway, there is another very
    well-regarded mechanism to influence the development roadmap: the user
    survey. Found at <link
    xlink:href="http://openstack.org/user-survey"></link>, it allows you to
    provide details of your deployments and needs, anonymously by default.
    Each cycle, the user committee analyzes the results and produces a report,
    including providing specific information to the technical committee and
    project team leads.</para>

    <title>Aspects to Watch</title>

    <para>You want to keep an eye on the areas improving within OpenStack. The
    best way to "watch" roadmaps for each project is to look at the blueprints
    that are being approved for work on milestone releases. You can also learn

      <para>A major quality push has occurred across drivers and plug-ins in
      Block Storage, Compute, and Networking. Particularly, developers of
      Compute and Networking drivers that require proprietary or hardware
      products are now required to provide an automated external testing
      system for use during the development process.</para>

    <section xml:id="roadmap-easier-upgrades">
      <title>Easier Upgrades</title>

      <para>One of the most requested features since OpenStack began (for
      components other than Object Storage, which tends to "just work"):
      easier upgrades. In all recent releases internal messaging communication
      is versioned, meaning services can theoretically drop back to
      backward-compatible behavior. This allows you to run later versions of
      some components, while keeping older versions of others.</para>

      <para>In addition, database migrations are now tested with the Turbo
      Hipster tool. This tool tests database migration performance on copies of
      real-world user databases.</para>

      <para>These changes have facilitated the first proper OpenStack upgrade
      guide, found in <xref linkend="ch_ops_upgrades" />, and will continue to

      <title>Deprecation of Nova Network</title>

      <para>With the introduction of the full software-defined networking
      stack provided by OpenStack Networking (neutron) in the Folsom release,
      development effort on the initial networking code that remains part of
      the Compute component has gradually lessened. While many still use
      <literal>nova-network</literal> in production, there has been a
      long-term plan to remove the code in favor of the more flexible and
      full-featured OpenStack Networking.<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>nova</primary>

          <secondary>deprecation of</secondary>
        </indexterm></para>

      <para>An attempt was made to deprecate <literal>nova-network</literal>
      during the Havana release, which was aborted due to the lack of
      equivalent functionality (such as the FlatDHCP multi-host
      high-availability mode mentioned in this guide), lack of a migration
      path between versions, insufficient testing, and simplicity when used
      for the more straightforward use cases <literal>nova-network</literal>
      traditionally supported. Though significant effort has been made to
      address these concerns, <literal>nova-network</literal> was not be
      deprecated in the Juno release. In addition, to a limited degree,
      patches to <literal>nova-network</literal> have again begin to be
      accepted, such as adding a per-network settings feature and SR-IOV
      support in Juno.<indexterm class="singular">

      <para>This leaves you with an important point of decision when designing
      your cloud. OpenStack Networking is robust enough to use with a small
      number of limitations (performance issues in some scenarios, only basic
      high availability of layer 3 systems) and provides many more features than
      <literal>nova-network</literal>. However, if you do not have the more
      complex use cases that can benefit from fuller software-defined
      networking capabilities, or are uncomfortable with the new concepts
      introduced, <literal>nova-network</literal> may continue to be a viable
      option for the next 12 months.</para>

      <para>Similarly, if you have an existing cloud and are looking to
      upgrade from <literal>nova-network</literal> to OpenStack Networking,
      you should have the option to delay the upgrade for this period of time.
      However, each release of OpenStack brings significant new innovation,
      and regardless of your use of networking methodology, it is likely best
      to begin planning for an upgrade within a reasonable timeframe of each
      release.</para>

      <para>As mentioned, there's currently no way to cleanly migrate from
      <literal>nova-network</literal> to neutron. We recommend that you keep a
      migration in mind and what that process might involve for when a proper
      migration path is released.</para>

  <section xml:id="roadmap-DVR">
    <title>Distributed Virtual Router</title>

    <para>One of the long-time complaints surrounding OpenStack Networking was
    the lack of high availability for the layer 3 components. The Juno release
    introduced Distributed Virtual Router (DVR), which aims to solve this
    problem.</para>
    <para>Early indications are that it does do this well for a base set of
    scenarios, such as using the ML2 plug-in with Open vSwitch, one flat
    external network and VXLAN tenant networks. However, it does appear that
    there are problems with the use of VLANs, IPv6, Floating IPs, high
    north-south traffic scenarios and large numbers of compute nodes. It is
    expected these will improve significantly with the next release, but
    bug reports on specific issues are highly desirable.</para>

    <para>The Modular Layer 2 plug-in is a framework allowing OpenStack
    Networking to simultaneously utilize the variety of layer-2 networking
    technologies found in complex real-world data centers. It currently works
    with the existing Open vSwitch, Linux Bridge, and Hyper-V L2 agents and is
    intended to replace and deprecate the monolithic plug-ins associated with
    those L2 agents.</para>

  <section xml:id="roadmap-new-api">
    <title>New API Versions</title>

    <para>The third version of the Compute API was broadly discussed and
    worked on during the Havana and Icehouse release cycles. Current
    discussions indicate that the V2 API will remain for many releases, and
    the next iteration of the API will be denoted v2.1 and have similar
    properties to the existing v2.0, rather than an entirely new v3 API.
    This is a great time to evaluate all API and provide comments
    while the next generation APIs are being defined. A new working group was
    formed specifically to
    <link xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/API_Working_Group">improve

    <title>Database as a Service (trove)</title>

    <para>The OpenStack community has had a database-as-a-service tool in
    development for some time, and we saw the first integrated
    release of it in Icehouse. From its release it was able to deploy database
    servers out of the box in a highly available way, initially supporting only
    MySQL. Juno introduced support for Mongo (including clustering), PostgreSQL and
    Couchbase, in addition to replication functionality for MySQL. In Kilo,
    more advanced clustering capability was delivered, in addition to better
    integration with other OpenStack components such as Networking.

    <para>Both Compute and Block Storage rely on schedulers to determine where
    to place virtual machines or volumes. In Havana, the Compute scheduler
    underwent significant improvement, while in Icehouse it was the scheduler in
    Block Storage that received a boost. Further down the track, an effort
    started this cycle that aims to create a holistic scheduler covering both
    will come to fruition. Some of the work that was done in Kilo can be found under the

      <title>Toward a Python SDK</title>

      <para>Though many successfully use the various python-*client code as an

      an <link xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/PythonOpenStackSDK">effort to improve the

      having several false starts. However, the early signs for the SDK
