  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>OpenStack is an open source platform that lets you build an
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud that runs on commodity
    hardware.</para>

  <section xml:id="introduction-to-openstack">
    <title>Introduction to OpenStack</title>

    <para>OpenStack believes in open source, open design, open
      development, all in an open community that encourages
      participation by anyone. The long-term vision for OpenStack is
      to produce a ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform
      that meets the needs of public and private cloud providers
      regardless of size. OpenStack services control large pools of
      compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a data
      center.</para>

    <para>The technology behind OpenStack consists of a series of
      interrelated projects delivering various components for a cloud
      infrastructure solution. Each service provides an open API so
      that all of these resources can be managed through a dashboard
      that gives administrators control while empowering users to
      provision resources through a web interface, a command-line
      client, or software development kits that support the API. Many
      OpenStack APIs are extensible, meaning you can keep
      compatibility with a core set of calls while providing access to
      more resources and innovating through API extensions. The
      OpenStack project is a global collaboration of developers and
      cloud computing technologists. The project produces an open
      standard cloud computing platform for both public and private
      clouds. By focusing on ease of implementation, massive
      scalability, a variety of rich features, and tremendous
      extensibility, the project aims to deliver a practical and
      reliable cloud solution for all types of organizations.</para>

  <section xml:id="preface_getting_started">
    <title>Getting Started with OpenStack</title>

    <para>As an open source project, one of the unique aspects of
      OpenStack is that it has many different levels at which you can
      begin to engage with it—you don't have to do everything
      yourself.</para>

    <section xml:id="preface_using_openstack">
      <title>Using OpenStack</title>

      <para>You could ask, "Do I even need to build a cloud?" If you
        want to start using a compute or storage service by just
        swiping your credit card, you can go to eNovance, HP,
        Rackspace, or other organizations to start using their public
        OpenStack clouds. Using their OpenStack cloud resources is
        similar to accessing the publicly available Amazon Web
        Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) or Simple Storage
        Solution (S3).</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="preface_plug_and_play">
      <title>Plug and Play OpenStack</title>

      <para>However, the enticing part of OpenStack might be to build your own
      private cloud, and there are several ways to accomplish this goal.
      Perhaps the simplest of all is an appliance-style solution. You purchase
      an appliance, unpack it, plug in the power and the network, and watch it
      transform into an OpenStack cloud with minimal additional configuration.
      Few, if any, other open source cloud products have such turnkey options.
      If a turnkey solution is interesting to you, take a look at Nebula
      One.</para>

      <para>However, hardware choice is important for many applications, so if
        that applies to you, consider that there are several software
        distributions available that you can run on servers, storage, and
        network products of your choosing. Canonical (where OpenStack replaced
        Eucalyptus as the default cloud option in 2011), Red Hat, and SUSE offer
        enterprise OpenStack solutions and support. You may also want to take a
        look at some of the specialized distributions, such as those from
        Rackspace, Piston, SwiftStack, or Cloudscaling.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, if you want someone to help guide you through the
      decisions about the underlying hardware or your applications, perhaps
      adding in a few features or integrating components along the way,
      consider contacting one of the system integrators with OpenStack
      experience, such as Mirantis or Metacloud.</para>

      <para>If your preference is to build your own OpenStack expertise
      internally, a good way to kick-start that might be to attend or arrange
      a training session. The OpenStack Foundation recently launched a <link
      xlink:href="http://www.openstack.org/marketplace/training">Training Marketplace</link> where
      you can look for nearby events. Also, the OpenStack community is <link
      xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Training-manuals">working to produce</link> open
      source training materials.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="preface_roll_your_own_openstack">
      <title>Roll Your Own OpenStack</title>

      <para>However, this guide has a different audience—those seeking
        flexibility from the OpenStack framework by conducting
        do-it-yourself solutions.</para>

      <para>OpenStack is designed for horizontal scalability, so you
        can easily add new compute, network, and storage resources to
        grow your cloud over time. In addition to the pervasiveness of
        massive OpenStack public clouds, many organizations, such as
        PayPal, Intel, and Comcast, build large-scale private clouds.
        OpenStack offers much more than a typical software package
        because it lets you integrate a number of different
        technologies to construct a cloud. This approach provides
        great flexibility, but the number of options might be daunting
        at first.</para>

    <title>Who This Book Is For</title>
    <para>This book is for those of you starting to run OpenStack
      clouds as well as those of you who were handed an operational
      one and want to keep it running well. Perhaps you're on a DevOps
      team, perhaps you are a system administrator starting to dabble
      in the cloud, or maybe you want to get on the OpenStack cloud
      team at your company. This book is for all of you.</para>
    <para>This guide assumes that you are familiar with a Linux
      distribution that supports OpenStack, SQL databases, and
      virtualization. You must be comfortable administering and
      configuring multiple Linux machines for networking. You must
      install and maintain an SQL database and occasionally run
      queries against it.</para>
    <para>One of the most complex aspects of an OpenStack cloud is the
      networking configuration. You should be familiar with concepts
      such as DHCP, Linux bridges, VLANs, and iptables. You must also
      have access to a network hardware expert who can configure the
      switches and routers required in your OpenStack cloud.</para>
    <tip>
      <para>Cloud computing is a quite advanced topic, and this book
        requires a lot of background knowledge. However, if you are
        fairly new to cloud computing, we recommend that you make use
        of the <xref linkend="openstack_glossary"/> at the back of the
        book, as well as the online documentation for OpenStack and
        additional resources mentioned in this book in <xref

    <title>Why and How We Wrote This Book</title>

    <para>We wrote this book because we have deployed and maintained
      OpenStack clouds for at least a year, and wanted to be able to
      distribute this knowledge to others. After months of being the
      point people for an OpenStack cloud, we also wanted to have a
      document to hand to our system administrators so that they'd
      know how to operate the cloud on a daily basis—both reactively
      and pro-actively. We wanted to provide more detailed technical
      information about the decisions that deployers make along the
      way.</para>

    <para>We wrote this book to help you:<itemizedlist role="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>Design and create an architecture for your first
            nontrivial OpenStack cloud. After you read this guide,
            you'll know which questions to ask and how to organize
            your compute, networking, and storage resources and the
            associated software packages.</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>We wrote this book in a book sprint, which is a facilitated,
      rapid development production method for books. For more
      information, see the <link xlink:href="http://www.booksprints.net/"
        >BookSprints site</link>. Your authors cobbled this book
      together in five days during February 2013, fueled by caffeine
      and the best takeout food that Austin, Texas, could <phrase
        role="keep-together">offer</phrase>.</para>

    <para>On the first day, we filled white boards with colorful
      sticky notes to start to shape this nebulous book about how to
      architect and operate clouds:<informalfigure>

        </mediaobject>
      </informalfigure></para>

    <para>We wrote furiously from our own experiences and bounced
      ideas between each other. At regular intervals we reviewed the
      shape and organization of the book and further molded it,
      leading to what you see today.</para>

    <title>How to Contribute to This Book</title>

    <para>The genesis of this book was an in-person event, but now
      that the book is in your hands, we want you to contribute to it.
      OpenStack documentation follows the coding principles of
      iterative work, with bug logging, investigating, and fixing. We
      also store the source content on GitHub and invite collaborators
      through the OpenStack Gerrit installation, which offers reviews.
      For the O'Reilly edition of this book, we are using the
      company's Atlas system, which also stores source content on
      GitHub and enables collaboration among contributors.</para>

    <para>If you find a bug and can't fix it or aren't sure it's
      really a doc bug, log a bug at <link

      Tag the bug under <guilabel>Extra</guilabel> options with the
        <literal>ops-guide</literal> tag to indicate that the bug is
      in this guide. You can assign the bug to yourself if you know
      how to fix it. Also, a member of the OpenStack doc-core team can
      triage the doc bug.</para>
