    <title>Designing for Cloud Controllers and Cloud Management</title>
    <para>OpenStack is designed to be massively horizontally scalable, which
        allows all services to be distributed widely. However, to simplify this
        guide we have decided to discuss services of a more central nature using
        the concept of a <emphasis>cloud controller</emphasis>. A cloud
        controller is just a conceptual simplification, and in the real world
        you likely will design an architecture for your cloud controller that
        enables high availability so the cloud controller tasks are spread out
        across more than a single node. The cloud controller provides the
        central management system for OpenStack deployments. Typically the cloud
        controller manages authentication and sends messaging to all the systems
        through a message queue.</para>
    <para>For more details about an overall example architecture, see the <xref
            linkend="example_architecture"/>.</para>
    <para>For many deployments, the cloud controller is a single node, but for
        high availability, you have considerations about the design to explore
        further in this chapter. The concept of a cloud controller hosts these
        necessary management services for the cloud:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Databases (tracks current information about users and
                    instances for example in a database, typically one database
                    instance managed per service)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Message queue services (all AMQP - Advanced Message Queue
                    Protocol - messages for services are received and sent
                    according to the queue broker)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Authentication and authorization for identity management
                    (indicates which users can do what actions on certain cloud
                    resources, quota management is spread out among services
                    however)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Image management services (stores and serves images with
                    metadata on each, for launching in the cloud)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Scheduling services (indicates which resources to use
                    first, for example, spreading out where instances are
                    launched based on an algorithm)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>User dashboard (provides a web-based front-end for users
                    to consume OpenStack cloud services)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>API endpoints (offers each service's REST API access,
                    where the API endpoint catalog is managed by the identity
                    service)</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    <para>For our example, the cloud controller has a collection of
            <code>nova-*</code> components that represent the global state of
        the cloud, talks to services such as authentication, maintains
        information about the cloud in a database, communicates to all compute
        nodes and storage <glossterm>worker</glossterm>s through a queue, and
        provides API access. Each service running on a designated cloud
        controller may be broken out into separate nodes for scalability or
        availability.</para>
    <para>As another example, you could use pairs of servers for a collective
        cloud controller - one active, one standby, for redundant nodes
        providing a given set of related services such as:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Front-end web for API requests, the scheduler for choosing
                    which compute node to boot an instance on, identity
                    services, and the dashboard</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Database and message queue server (such as MySQL,
                    RabbitMQ)</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Image Service for the image management</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    <para>Now that you see the myriad designs for controlling your cloud, read
        more about the further considerations to help with your design decisions.</para>
    <section xml:id="hardware_consid">
        <title>Hardware Considerations</title>
        <para>A cloud controller's hardware can be the same as a
            compute node, though you may want to further specify based
            on the size and type of cloud that you run.</para>
        <para>It's also possible to use virtual machines for all or
            some of the services that the cloud controller manages,
            such as the message queuing. In this guide, we assume that
            all services are running directly on the cloud
            controller.</para>
        <para>To size the server correctly, and determine whether to
            virtualize any part of it, you should estimate:</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Whether users authenticate against an external

        <para>One choice that always comes up is whether to virtualize
            or not. Some services, such as nova-compute, swift-proxy
            and swift-object servers, should not be virtualized.
            However, control servers can often be happily virtualized
            - the performance penalty can usually be offset by simply
            running more of the service.</para>

    <section xml:id="database">
        <title>Database</title>
        <para>OpenStack Compute uses a SQL database to store and
            retrieve stateful information. MySQL is the popular
            database choice in the OpenStack community.</para>
        <para>Loss of the database leads to errors. As a result, we
            recommend that you cluster your database to make it
            failure tolerant. Configuring and maintaining a database
            cluster is done outside of OpenStack and is determined by
            the database software you choose to use in your cloud
            environment. MySQL/Galera is a popular option for
            MySQL-based databases.</para>

        <para>Most OpenStack services communicate with each other using the

            services and networking services through the message queue. Also,
            you can optionally enable notifications for any service. RabbitMQ,
            Qpid, and 0mq are all popular choices for a message queue service.
            In general, if the message queue fails or becomes inaccessible, the
            cluster grinds to a halt and ends up in a "read only" state, with
            information stuck at the point where the last message was sent.
            Accordingly, we recommend that you cluster the message queue. Be
            aware that clustered message queues can be a pain point for many
            OpenStack deployments. While RabbitMQ has native clustering support,
            there have been reports of issues when running it at a large scale.
            While there are other queuing solutions
            available such as 0mq and Qpid, 0mq does not offer stateful queues.
            Qpid is the messaging system of choice for RedHat and its
            derivatives. Qpid does not have native clustering capabilities and
            requires a supplemental service like Pacemaker or Corsync. For your
            message queue, you need to determine a) what level of data loss you
            are comfortable with, and b) whether to use an OpenStack project's
            ability to retry multiple MQ hosts in the event of a failure, such
            as using Compute's ability to do so.</para>

        <title>Application Programming Interface (API)</title>
        <para>All public access, whether direct, through a command
            line client, or through the web-based dashboard, uses the
            API service. Find the API reference at <link
                xlink:href="http://api.openstack.org/"
                >http://api.openstack.org/</link>.</para>
        <para>You must choose whether you want to support the Amazon
            EC2 compatibility APIs, or just the OpenStack APIs. One
            issue you might encounter when running both APIs is an
            inconsistent experience when referring to images and
            instances.</para>
        <para>For example, the EC2 API refers to instances using IDs
            that contain hexadecimal whereas the OpenStack API uses
            names and digits. Similarly, the EC2 API tends to rely on
            DNS aliases for contacting virtual machines, as opposed to
            OpenStack which typically lists IP addresses.</para>
        <para>If OpenStack is not set up in the right way, it is
            simple to have scenarios where users are unable to contact
            their instances due to only having an incorrect DNS alias.
            Despite this, EC2 compatibility can assist users migrating
            to your cloud.</para>
        <para>Like databases and message queues, having more than one
                <glossterm>API server</glossterm> is a good thing.
            Traditional HTTP load balancing techniques can be used to
            achieve a highly available <code>nova-api</code>
            service.</para>

            (http://docs.openstack.org/api/api-specs.html) define the
            core actions, capabilities, and media-types of the
            OpenStack API. A client can always depend on the
            availability of this core API and implementers are always
            required to support it in its entirety. Requiring strict
            adherence to the core API allows clients to rely upon a
            minimal level of functionality when interacting with
            multiple implementations of the same API.</para>
        <para>The OpenStack Compute API is extensible. An extension
            adds capabilities to an API beyond those defined in the
            core. The introduction of new features, MIME types,
            actions, states, headers, parameters, and resources can
            all be accomplished by means of extensions to the core
            API. This allows the introduction of new features in the
            API without requiring a version change and allows the
            introduction of vendor-specific niche
            functionality.</para>

    <section xml:id="scheduling">
        <title>Scheduling</title>
        <para>The scheduling services are responsible for determining
            the compute or storage node where a virtual machine or
            block storage volume should be created. The scheduling
            services receive creation requests for these resources
            from the message queue and then begin the process of
            determining the appropriate node where the resource should
            reside. This process is done by applying a series
            user-configurable filters against the available collection
            of nodes.</para>
        <para>There are currently two schedulers: nova-scheduler for
            virtual machines and cinder-scheduler for block storage
            volumes. Both schedulers are able to scale horizontally,
            so for high availability purposes, or for very large or
            high-schedule frequency installations, you should consider
            running multiple instances of each scheduler. The
            schedulers all listen to the shared message queue, so no
            special load balancing is required.</para>

    <section xml:id="images">
        <title>Images</title>
        <para>The OpenStack Image Catalog and Delivery service
            consists of two parts - <code>glance-api</code> and
                <code>glance-registry</code>. The former is
            responsible for the delivery of images and the compute
            node uses it to download images from the back-end. The
            latter maintains the metadata information associated with
            virtual machine images and requires a database.</para>
        <para>The <code>glance-api</code> part is an abstraction layer
            that allows a choice of back-end. Currently, it
            supports:</para>

        <para>If you have an OpenStack Object Storage service, we recommend using this as a scalable

            or Amazon S3 - unless you do not need the ability to upload new images through
            OpenStack.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="dashboard">
        <title>Dashboard</title>
        <para>The OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides a web-based
            user interface to the various OpenStack components. The
            dashboard includes an end-user area for users to manage
            their virtual infrastructure as well as an admin area for
            cloud operators to manage the OpenStack environment as a
            whole.</para>
        <para>The dashboard is implemented as a Python web
            application that normally runs in <glossterm>Apache</glossterm>
            <code>httpd</code>. Therefore, you may treat it the same
            as any other web application, provided it can reach the
            API servers (including their admin endpoints) over the
            network.</para>

    <section xml:id="authentication">
        <title>Authentication and Authorization</title>
        <para>The concepts supporting OpenStack's authentication and
            authorization are derived from well understood and widely
            used systems of a similar nature. Users have credentials
            they can use to authenticate, and they can be a member of
            one or more groups (known as projects or tenants
            interchangeably).</para>
        <para>For example, a cloud administrator might be able to list
            all instances in the cloud, whereas a user can only see
            those in their current group. Resources quotas, such as
            the number of cores that can be used, disk space, and so
            on, are associated with a project.</para>
        <para>The OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone) is the point
            that provides the authentication decisions and user
            attribute information, which is then used by the other
            OpenStack services to perform authorization. Policy is set
            in the <filename>policy.json</filename> file. For
            information on how to configure these, see <xref
                linkend="projects_users"/>.</para>
        <para>The Identity Service supports different plugins for
            authentication decisions and identity storage. Examples of
            these plugins include:</para>

            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Many deployments use the SQL database, however LDAP is
            also a popular choice for those with existing
            authentication infrastructure that needs to be
            integrated.</para>
    </section>
    <?hard-pagebreak?>
    <section xml:id="network_consid">
        <title>Network Considerations</title>
        <para>Because the cloud controller handles so many different
            services, it must be able to handle the amount of traffic
            that hits it. For example, if you choose to host the
            OpenStack Imaging Service on the cloud controller, the
            cloud controller should be able to support the
            transferring of the images at an acceptable speed.</para>
        <para>As another example, if you choose to use single-host
            networking where the cloud controller is the network
            gateway for all instances, then the Cloud Controller must
            support the total amount of traffic that travels between
            your cloud and the public Internet.</para>
        <para>We recommend that you use a fast NIC, such as 10 GB. You
            can also choose to use two 10 GB NICs and bond them
            together. While you might not be able to get a full bonded
            20 GB speed, different transmission streams use different
            NICs. For example, if the Cloud Controller transfers two
            images, each image uses a different NIC and gets a full 10
            GB of bandwidth.</para>
