  <title>Upstream OpenStack</title>

  <para>OpenStack is founded on a thriving community that is a source of help
  and welcomes your contributions. This chapter details some of the ways you
  can interact with the others involved.</para>

  <section xml:id="get_help">
    <title>Getting Help</title>

    <para>There are several avenues available for seeking assistance. The
    quickest way is to help the community help you. Search the Q&amp;A sites,
    mailing list archives, and bug lists for issues similar to yours. If you
    can't find anything, follow the directions for reporting bugs or use one
    of the channels for support, which are listed below.<indexterm

      </indexterm></para>

    <para>Your first port of call should be the official OpenStack
    documentation, found on <link
    xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org"></link>. You can get questions
    answered on <link xlink:href="http://ask.openstack.org"></link>.</para>

    <para><link xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists">Mailing lists</link> are
    also a great place to get help. The wiki page has more information about
    the various lists. As an operator, the main lists you should be aware of
    are:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><link xlink:href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack">General

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>openstack@lists.openstack.org</emphasis>. The scope
          of this list is the current state of OpenStack. This is a very
          high-traffic mailing list, with many, many emails per day.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><link xlink:href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-operators">Operators
        list</link></term>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>openstack-operators@lists.openstack.org.</emphasis>
          This list is intended for discussion among existing OpenStack cloud
          operators, such as yourself. Currently, this list is relatively low
          traffic, on the order of one email a day.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><link xlink:href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-dev">Development
        list</link></term>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org</emphasis>. The
          scope of this list is the future state of OpenStack. This is a
          high-traffic mailing list, with multiple emails per day.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>We recommend that you subscribe to the general list and the operator
    list, although you must set up filters to manage the volume for the
    general list. You'll also find links to the mailing list archives on the
    mailing list wiki page, where you can search through the
    discussions.</para>

    <para><link xlink:href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC">Multiple IRC
    channels</link> are available for general questions and developer
    discussions. The general discussion channel is #openstack on
    <emphasis>irc.freenode.net</emphasis>.</para>

  <section xml:id="report_bugs">
    <title>Reporting Bugs</title>

    <para>As an operator, you are in a very good position to report unexpected
    behavior with your cloud. Since OpenStack is flexible, you may be the only
    individual to report a particular issue. Every issue is important to fix,
    so it is essential to learn how to easily submit a bug report.<indexterm

      </indexterm></para>

    <para>All OpenStack projects use <link
    xlink:href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</link>&#160;for bug
    tracking. You'll need to create an account on Launchpad before you can
    submit a bug report.</para>

    <para>Once you have a Launchpad account, reporting a bug is as simple as
    identifying the project or projects that are causing the issue. Sometimes
    this is more difficult than expected, but those working on the bug triage
    are happy to help relocate issues if they are not in the right place
    initially:</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>To write a good bug report, the following process is essential.
    First, search for the bug to make sure there is no bug already filed for
    the same issue. If you find one, be sure to click on "This bug affects X
    people. Does this bug affect you?" If you can't find the issue, then enter
    the details of your report. It should at least include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The release, or milestone, or commit ID corresponding to the
        software that you are running</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The operating system and version where you've identified the
        bug</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Steps to reproduce the bug, including what went wrong</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Description of the expected results instead of what you
        saw</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Portions of your log files so that you include only relevant
        excerpts</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When you do this, the bug is created with:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Status: <emphasis>New</emphasis></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>In the bug comments, you can contribute instructions on how to fix a
    given bug, and set it to <emphasis>Triaged</emphasis>. Or you can directly
    fix it: assign the bug to yourself, set it to <emphasis>In
    progress</emphasis>, branch the code, implement the fix, and propose your
    change for merging. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; there are bug
    triaging tasks as well.</para>

    <section xml:id="confirm_priority">
      <title>Confirming and Prioritizing</title>

      <para>This stage is about checking that a bug is real and assessing its
      impact. Some of these steps require bug supervisor rights (usually
      limited to core teams). If the bug lacks information to properly
      reproduce or assess the importance of the bug, the bug is set to:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Status: <emphasis>Incomplete</emphasis></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Once you have reproduced the issue (or are 100 percent confident
      that this is indeed a valid bug) and have permissions to do so,
      set:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Status: <emphasis>Confirmed</emphasis></para>
        </listitem>

      <para>Core developers also prioritize the bug, based on its
      impact:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

          <para>Importance: &lt;Bug impact&gt;</para>

      <para>The bug impacts are categorized as follows:</para>

      <?hard-pagebreak ?>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Critical</emphasis> if the bug prevents a key

          a simple workaround) or results in data loss</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>High</emphasis> if the bug prevents a key feature
          from working properly for some users (or with a workaround)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Medium</emphasis> if the bug prevents a secondary
          feature from working properly</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Low</emphasis> if the bug is mostly cosmetic</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          but rather a welcome change in behavior</para>

      <para>If the bug contains the solution, or a patch, set the bug status
      to <emphasis>Triaged</emphasis>.</para>

    <section xml:id="bug_fixing">
      <title>Bug Fixing</title>

      <para>At this stage, a developer works on a fix. During that time, to
      avoid duplicating the work, the developer should set:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Status: <emphasis>In Progress</emphasis></para>

      <para>After the change is reviewed, accepted, and lands in master, it

    <para>As a community, we take security very seriously and follow a

    you discover through this specific process. The OpenStack Vulnerability
    Management Team is a very small group of experts in vulnerability
    management drawn from the OpenStack community. The team's job is
    facilitating the reporting of vulnerabilities, coordinating security fixes
    and handling progressive disclosure of the vulnerability information.
