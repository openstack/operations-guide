  <title>Example Architectures</title>

  <para>To understand the possibilities OpenStack offers, it's best to start
  with basic architectures that are tried-and-true and have been tested in
  production environments. We offer two such examples with basic pivots on the
  base operating system (Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and the
  networking architectures. There are other differences between these two
  examples, but you should find the considerations made for the choices in
  each as well as a rationale for why it worked well in a given
  environment.</para>

  <para>Because OpenStack is highly configurable, with many different back ends
  and network configuration options, it is difficult to write documentation
  that covers all possible OpenStack deployments. Therefore, this guide
  defines example architectures to simplify the task of documenting, as well
  as to provide the scope for this guide. Both of the offered architecture
  examples are currently running in production and serving users.</para>

    <para>As always, refer to the <xref linkend="openstack_glossary" /> if you
    are unclear about any of the terminology mentioned in these
    architectures.</para>

    <para>With so many considerations and options available, our hope is to
    provide a few clearly-marked and tested paths for your OpenStack
    exploration. If you're looking for additional ideas, check out <xref
