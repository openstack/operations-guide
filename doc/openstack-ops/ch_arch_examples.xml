  <title>Architecture Examples</title>

  <para>To understand the possibilities that OpenStack offers, it's best to start
  with basic architecture that has been tested in
  production environments. We offer two examples with basic pivots on the
  base operating system (Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and the
  networking architecture. There are other differences between these two
  examples and this guide provides reasons for each choice made.</para>

  <para>Because OpenStack is highly configurable, with many different back ends
  and network configuration options, it is difficult to write documentation
  that covers all possible OpenStack deployments. Therefore, this guide
  defines examples of architecture to simplify the task of documenting, as well
  as to provide the scope for this guide. Both of the offered architecture
  examples are currently running in production and serving users.</para>

    <para>As always, refer to the <xref linkend="openstack_glossary" /> if you
    are unclear about any of the terminology mentioned in architecture
    examples.</para>

    <para>With so many considerations and options available, our hope is to
    provide a few clearly-marked and tested paths for your OpenStack
    exploration. If you're looking for additional ideas, check out <xref
