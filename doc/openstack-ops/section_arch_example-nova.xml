  <title>Example Architecture—Legacy Networking (nova)</title>

  <para>This particular example architecture has been upgraded from Grizzly to
  Havana and tested in production environments where many public IP addresses
  are available for assignment to multiple instances. You can find a second
  example architecture that uses OpenStack Networking (neutron) after this
  section. Each example offers high availability, meaning that if a particular
  node goes down, another node with the same configuration can take over the
  tasks so that the services continue to be available.<indexterm class="singular">

    <para>The simplest architecture you can build upon for Compute has a
    single cloud controller and multiple compute nodes. The simplest
    architecture for Object Storage has five nodes: one for identifying users
    and proxying requests to the API, then four for storage itself to provide
    enough replication for eventual consistency. This example architecture
    does not dictate a particular number of nodes, but shows the thinking

      <title>Rationale</title>

      <para>This example architecture has been selected based on the current
      default feature set of OpenStack <glossterm>Havana</glossterm>, with an
      emphasis on stability. We believe that many clouds that currently run
      OpenStack in production have made similar choices.<indexterm
          class="singular">
          <primary>legacy networking (nova)</primary>

          <secondary>rationale for choice of</secondary>
        </indexterm></para>

      <para>You must first choose the operating system that runs on all of the
      physical nodes. While OpenStack is supported on several distributions of
      Linux, we used <emphasis>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Long Term
      Support)</emphasis>, which is used by the majority of the development
      community, has feature completeness compared with other distributions
      and has clear future support plans.</para>

      <para>We recommend that you do not use the default Ubuntu OpenStack
      install packages and instead use the <link
      xlink:href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/CloudArchive">Ubuntu Cloud Archive</link>. The
      Cloud Archive is a package repository supported by Canonical that allows
      you to upgrade to future OpenStack releases while remaining on Ubuntu
      12.04.</para>

      <para><emphasis>KVM</emphasis> as a <glossterm>hypervisor</glossterm>
      complements the choice of Ubuntu—being a matched pair in terms of
      support, and also because of the significant degree of attention it
      garners from the OpenStack development community (including the authors,
      who mostly use KVM). It is also feature complete, free from licensing
      charges and restrictions.<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>kernel-based VM (KVM) hypervisor</primary>
        </indexterm><indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>hypervisors</primary>

          <secondary>KVM</secondary>
        </indexterm></para>

      <para><emphasis>MySQL</emphasis> follows a similar trend. Despite its
      recent change of ownership, this database is the most tested for use
      with OpenStack and is heavily documented. We deviate from the default
      database, <emphasis>SQLite</emphasis>, because SQLite is not an
      appropriate database for production usage.</para>

      <para>The choice of <emphasis>RabbitMQ</emphasis> over other AMQP
      compatible options that are gaining support in OpenStack, such as ZeroMQ
      and Qpid, is due to its ease of use and significant testing in
      production. It also is the only option that supports features such as
      Compute cells. We recommend clustering with RabbitMQ, as it is an
      integral component of the system and fairly simple to implement due to
      its inbuilt nature.<indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</primary>
        </indexterm></para>

      <para>As discussed in previous chapters, there are several options for
      networking in OpenStack Compute. We recommend
      <emphasis>FlatDHCP</emphasis> and to use <emphasis>Multi-Host</emphasis>
      networking mode for high availability, running one
      <code>nova-network</code> daemon per OpenStack compute host. This
      provides a robust mechanism for ensuring network interruptions are
      isolated to individual compute hosts, and allows for the direct use of
      hardware network gateways.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Live Migration</emphasis> is supported by way of shared
      storage, with <emphasis>NFS</emphasis> as the distributed file
      system.</para>

      <para>Acknowledging that many small-scale deployments see running Object
      Storage just for the storage of virtual machine images as too costly, we
      opted for the file back end in the OpenStack Image service (Glance). If
      your cloud will include Object Storage, you can easily add it as a
      back end.</para>

      <para>We chose the <emphasis>SQL back end for Identity</emphasis>
      over others, such as LDAP. This back end is simple
      to install and is robust. The authors acknowledge that many
      installations want to bind with existing directory services and caution
      careful understanding of the <link xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/havana/config-reference/content/ch_configuring-openstack-identity.html#configuring-keystone-for-ldap-backend"
      xlink:title="LDAP config options">array of options
      available</link>.</para>

      <para>Block Storage (cinder) is installed natively on external storage
      nodes and uses the <emphasis>LVM/iSCSI plug-in</emphasis>. Most Block
      Storage plug-ins are tied to particular vendor products and
      implementations limiting their use to consumers of those hardware
      platforms, but LVM/iSCSI is robust and stable on commodity
      hardware.</para>

      <?hard-pagebreak ?>

      <para>While the cloud can be run without the <emphasis>OpenStack
      Dashboard</emphasis>, we consider it to be indispensable, not just for
      user interaction with the cloud, but also as a tool for operators.
      Additionally, the dashboard's use of Django makes it a flexible
      framework for <phrase role="keep-together">extension</phrase>.</para>

      <title>Why not use OpenStack Networking?</title>

      <para>This example architecture does not use OpenStack Networking,

    synchronizes time on all the nodes. FlatDHCPManager in multi-host mode is
    used for the networking. A logical diagram for this example architecture
    shows which services are running on each node:</para>

    <para>The cloud controller runs the dashboard, the API services, the

    services (keystone, <code>nova-consoleauth</code>), Image services
    (<code>glance-api</code>, <code>glance-registry</code>), services for
    console access of guests, and Block Storage services, including the
    scheduler for storage resources (<code>cinder-api</code> and
    <code>cinder-scheduler</code>).<indexterm class="singular">

      </indexterm></para>

    <para>Compute nodes are where the computing resources are held, and in our
    example architecture, they run the hypervisor (KVM), libvirt (the driver
    for the hypervisor, which enables live migration from node to node),
    <code>nova-compute</code>, <code>nova-api-metadata</code> (generally only
    used when running in multi-host mode, it retrieves instance-specific
    metadata), <code>nova-vncproxy</code>, and
    <code>nova-network</code>.</para>

    <para>The network consists of two switches, one for the management or
    private traffic, and one that covers public access, including floating
    IPs. To support this, the cloud controller and the compute nodes have two
    network cards. The OpenStack Block Storage and NFS storage servers only
    need to access the private network and therefore only need one network
    card, but multiple cards run in a bonded configuration are recommended if
    possible. Floating IP access is direct to the Internet, whereas Flat IP
    access goes through a NAT. To envision the network traffic, use this
    diagram:</para>
