        <para>Who uses it: Researchers from the Australian publicly
            funded research sector. Use is across a wide variety of
            disciplines, with the purpose of instances being from
            running simple web servers to using hundreds of cores for
            high throughput computing.</para>

            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>Using OpenStack Compute Cells, the NeCTAR Cloud
                spans eight sites with approximately 4,000 cores per
                site.</para>
            <para>Each site runs a different configuration, as
                resource <glossterm>cell</glossterm>s in an OpenStack
                Compute cells setup. Some sites span multiple data
                centers, some use off compute node storage with a
                shared file system and some use on compute node
                storage with a non-shared file system. Each site
                deploys the Image Service with an Object Storage
                back-end. A central Identity Service, Dashboard and
                Compute API Service is used. Login to the Dashboard
                triggers a SAML login with Shibboleth, that creates an
                    <glossterm>account</glossterm> in the Identity
                Service with an SQL back-end.</para>
            <para>Compute nodes have 24 to 48 cores, with at least 4
                GB of RAM per core and approximately 40 GB of
                ephemeral storage per core.</para>
            <para>All sites are based on Ubuntu 12.04 with KVM as the
                hypervisor. The OpenStack version in use is typically
                the current stable version, with 5 to 10% back ported
                code from trunk and modifications.</para>

        <title>MIT CSAIL</title>
        <para>Who uses it: Researchers from the MIT Computer Science
            and Artificial Intelligence Lab.</para>
        <section xml:id="mit_csail_deploy">
            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>The CSAIL cloud is currently 64 physical nodes with
            a total of 768 physical cores and 3,456 GB of RAM.
            Persistent data storage is largely outside of the cloud on
            NFS with cloud resources focused on compute
            resources. There are more than 130 users in more than 40
            projects with typically running 2,000 - 2,500 vCPUs in 300
            to 400 instances.</para>
            <para>We initially deployed on Ubuntu 12.04 with the Essex
            release of OpenStack using FlatDHCP multi host
            networking.</para>
            <para>The software stack is still Ubuntu 12.04 LTS but now
            with OpenStack Havana from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. KVM
            is the hypervisor, deployed using <link
            xlink:href="http://fai-project.org">FAI</link>
            (http://fai-project.org/) and Puppet for configuration
            management. The FAI and Puppet combination is used lab
            wide, not only for OpenStack. There is a single cloud
            controller node, which also acts as network controller,
            the remainder of the server hardware dedicated to compute
            nodes.</para>
            <para>Host aggregates and instance type extra specs are
            used to provide two different resource allocation
            ratios. The default resource allocation ratios we use are
            4:1 CPU and 1.5:1 RAM. Compute intensive workload use
            instance types that require non-oversubscribed hosts where
            cpu_ratio and ram_ration are both set to 1.0.  Since we
            have HyperThreading enabled on our compute nodes this
            provides one vCPU per CPU thread, or two vCPU per
            physical core.</para>
            <para>With our upgrade to Grizzly in August 2013 we moved
            to OpenStack Networking Service, Neutron (Quantum at the
            time). Compute nodes have two gigabit network interfaces
            and a separate management card for IPMI management. One
            network interface is used for node to node
            communications. The other is used as a trunk port for
            OpenStack managed VLANs. The controller node uses two
            bonded 10g network interfaces for it's public IP
            communications. Big pipes are used here because images are
            served over this port and it is also used to connect to
            iSCSI storage backending the image storage and
            database. The controller node also has a gigabit interface
            that is used in trunk mode for OpenStack managed VLAN
            traffic, this port handles traffic to the dhcp-agent and
            metadata-proxy.</para>
            <para>We approximate the older nova-networking multi-host
            HA setup by using 'provider vlan networks' that connect
            instances directly to existing publicly addressable
            networks and use existing physical routers as their
            default gateway.  This means that if our network
            controller goes down running instances will still have
            their network available and no single Linux host becomes a
            traffic bottleneck. We are able to to this because we have
            a sufficient supply of IPv4 addresses to cover all of our
            instances and thus don't need NAT and don't use floating
            IP address.  We provide a single generic public network to
            all projects and additional existing VLANs on a project by
            project basis as needed.  Individual projects are also
            allowed to create their own private GRE based
            networks.</para>

        <title>DAIR</title>
        <para>Who uses it: DAIR is an integrated virtual environment
            that leverages the CANARIE network to develop and test new
            information communication technology (ICT) and other
            digital technologies. It combines such digital
            infrastructure as advanced networking, and cloud computing
            and storage to create an environment for develop and test
            of innovative ICT applications, protocols and services,
            perform at-scale experimentation for deployment, and
            facilitate a faster time to market.</para>
        <section xml:id="dair_deploy">
            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>DAIR is hosted at two different data centres across
                Canada: one in Alberta and the other in Quebec. It
                consists of a cloud controller at each location,
                however, one is designated as the "master" controller
                that is in charge of central authentication and
                quotas. This is done through custom scripts and light
                modifications to OpenStack. DAIR is currently running
                Folsom.</para>
            <para>For Object Storage, each region has a Swift
                environment.</para>
            <para>A NetApp appliance is used in each region for both
                block storage and instance storage. There are future
                plans to move the instances off of the NetApp
                appliance and onto a distributed file system such as
                    <glossterm>Ceph</glossterm> or GlusterFS.</para>
            <para>VlanManager is used extensively for network
                management. All servers have two bonded 10gb NICs that
                are connected to two redundant switches. DAIR is set
                up to use single-node networking where the cloud
                controller is the gateway for all instances on all
                compute nodes. Internal OpenStack traffic (for
                example, storage traffic) does not go through the
                cloud controller.</para>

            <title>Deployment</title>
            <para>The environment is largely based on Scientific Linux
                6, which is Red Hat compatible. We use KVM as our
                primary hypervisor although tests are ongoing with
                Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008.</para>
            <para>We use the Puppet Labs OpenStack modules to
                configure Compute, Image Service, Identity Service and
                Dashboard. Puppet is used widely for instance
                configuration and Foreman as a GUI for reporting and
                instance provisioning.</para>
            <para>Users and Groups are managed through Active

            around 3400 Nova Compute nodes, with approximately 60,000 cores.
